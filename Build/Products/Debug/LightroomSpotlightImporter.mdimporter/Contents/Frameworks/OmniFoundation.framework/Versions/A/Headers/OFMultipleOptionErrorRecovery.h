// The list of options can be a mixture of strings and class objects (subclasses of OFErrorRecovery).  If a string is found, it is used as the title for the next OFErrorRecover created.  Otherwise, the OFErrorRecovery's default title is used.  If two strings in a row are found or a string is found before the terminating nil, the behavior is undefined, but currently you'll get an assertion failure and the string will be ignored.
