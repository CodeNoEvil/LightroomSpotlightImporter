// OFBulkBlockPool provides an optimized way to allocate a large number of fixed size blocks quickly and with very little overhead.  Currently, only double-word alignment is guaranteed (so you shouldn't attempt to store doubles or long longs in your blocks).  This works best for small blocks.  The amount of wasted space goes up proportionally to the size of the block.  The block size must be at least the size of a pointer.  In order to maximize performance, OFBulkBlockPool is not thread-safe.  The caller is responsible for providing this functionality should it be needed.
//
// Allocation is slightly faster than deallocation.  Free pages are not deallocated when all of the contained blocks on that pages are deallocated.  This could be implemented without too much trouble, but it would take up some small amount of space and time.
